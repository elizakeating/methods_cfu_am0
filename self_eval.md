# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - I am proud of how I managed my time today, it feels like I found an efficient system of when I should get up and take breaks and when and how long I should completely zone into work.
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    - Methods allow you to do the same thing for multiple variables without having to type all of the lines of code again. Say you needed to check something multiple time with if statements, or add something to a variable multiple times. It is easier to write one method that you can call than to just type that code over and over again.
